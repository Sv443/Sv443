### Hi there, I'm Sv443,
real name being Sven ðŸ˜ƒ  
I am a 19 year old Full Stack Developer from [Stuttgart, Germany.](https://goo.gl/maps/fnQBaP3c9xpkwVnt9)  
My interests are in open source software, server and web development and hardware.  
Most of my projects are made with Node.js, nginx, Linux, Arduino or C++.  
Although I love working in a familiar environment, I'm always open to try out new technologies and want to continue learning and improving my skills.  
  
### What I'm currently working on:
- [JokeAPI](https://github.com/Sv443/JokeAPI), which is an API that serves jokes. It is my most used project and the one I am dedicating the most time to [(read more)](https://jokeapi.dev)
- [Townly](https://github.com/Sv443/Townly) - I've challenged myself to create a city building game in the command line, with an accompanying game engine, [Teng.](https://github.com/Sv443/Teng)
- [SvCoreLib](https://github.com/Sv443/SvCoreLib), which is a Node.js package that is used in basically all of my JavaScript projects. It also contains many miscellaneous features.
