### Hi there, I'm Sv443,
but you can call me Sven ðŸ˜ƒ  
I am an 18 year old Full Stack Developer from Stuttgart, Germany.  
My interests are in open source software, server and web development and hardware.  
Most of my projects are made with Node.js, nginx, Linux, Arduino or Qt Creator.  
Although I love working in a familiar environment, I always love to try out new technologies and want to continue learning and improving my skills.  
  
I'm up for collaboration, so if you have an interesting project in mind, feel free to contact me :)  


### What I'm currently working on:
- [JokeAPI](https://github.com/Sv443/JokeAPI), which is an API that (basically) serves jokes. It is currently my most used project and the one I am dedicating the most time towards.
- [sBot](https://github.com/Sv443/sBot) - my main Discord bot. It can do a lot of stuff, from moderation to some fun little features ([more info](https://sv443.net/r/sBot)).
- [JSLib](https://github.com/Sv443/JSLib-npm), which is a Node.js package that is used in basically all of my JavaScript projects. It also contains many miscellaneous features.
