### Hi there, I'm Sven
I am a 21 year old full stack developer from Germany.  
My interests are in open source software, server and web development, as well as PC and server hardware and IT infrastructure.  
Most of my projects are made with or for Javascript, Linux and Arduino.  
Although I love working in a familiar environment, I'm always open to try out new technologies and want to continue learning and improving my skills.  
  
### What I'm currently working on:
- [JokeAPI](https://github.com/Sv443/JokeAPI) is an API that serves a good variety of uniformly formatted jokes and offers lots of filtering methods.
- [SvCoreLib](https://github.com/Sv443-Network/SvCoreLib), which is a Node.js package that is used in basically all of my JavaScript projects. It contains many miscellaneous features.
- [BetterYTM](https://github.com/Sv443/BetterYTM), a userscript that brings various features and UX improvements to YouTube Music.
- [geniURL](https://github.com/Sv443/geniURL), an API for looking up and filtering song metadata from genius.com

My projects are free and open source so I rely on donations to keep my servers and domains running.

Massive thanks to my sponsors ❤
