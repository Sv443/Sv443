### Hi there, I'm Sven
I am a 22 year old full stack developer from Germany.  
My interests are in open source software, server and web development, as well as general electronic hardware and IT infrastructure.  
Most of my projects are made with or for JavaScript, TypeScript, Linux and Arduino.  
Although I love quickly getting something done in a familiar environment, I'm always open to try out new technologies and want to continue broadening my skills.  
  
### My active projects:
- [BetterYTM](https://github.com/Sv443/BetterYTM), a userscript that brings tons of features and UX improvements to YouTube Music.
- [geniURL](https://github.com/Sv443/geniURL), which is an API for looking up and filtering song metadata from genius.com
- [UserUtils](https://github.com/Sv443-Network/UserUtils), a general purpose library with tons of utilities for userscripts. It's used extensively by [BetterYTM](https://github.com/Sv443/BetterYTM)
<!--- [YTInfoBot](https://github.com/Sv443/YTInfoBot), a free Discord bot that replies to YouTube links with crowdsourced info (like and dislike counts, video timestamps and desensationalized thumbnails and titles). -->

### My template repos:
- [Userscript.ts](https://github.com/Sv443/Userscript.ts), a template for creating Userscripts in TypeScript with tons of modern utilities and comfort features.
- [BetterYTM-Plugin-Template](https://github.com/Sv443/BetterYTM-Plugin-Template), used for creating a plugin using [BetterYTM](https://github.com/Sv443/BetterYTM)'s API to further improve YouTube and YouTube Music.
- [Electron-Template](https://github.com/Sv443/Electron-Template), a barebone TypeScript, Electron, Vite and ESLint template.
- [React-Three-Electron-Template](https://github.com/Sv443/React-Three-Electron-Template), an extensive template for React, MUI, Three.js, Electron, TypeScript and Vite projects.
