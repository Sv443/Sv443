### Hi there, I'm Sven
I am a 22 year old full stack developer from Germany.  
My interests are in open source software, server and web development, as well as PC and server hardware and IT infrastructure.  
Most of my projects are made with or for Javascript, Linux and Arduino.  
Although I love working in a familiar environment, I'm always open to try out new technologies and want to continue learning and improving my skills.  
  
### Active projects:
- [BetterYTM](https://github.com/Sv443/BetterYTM), a userscript that brings tons of features and UX improvements to YouTube Music.
- [geniURL](https://github.com/Sv443/geniURL), an API for looking up and filtering song metadata from genius.com
- [YTInfoBot](https://github.com/Sv443/YTInfoBot), a free Discord bot that replies to YouTube links with crowdsourced info (like and dislike counts, video timestamps and desensationalized thumbnails and titles). 

### Template repos:
- [BetterYTM-Plugin-Template](https://github.com/Sv443/BetterYTM-Plugin-Template) - Template for creating a plugin using BetterYTM's API to further improve YouTube and YouTube Music.
- [Userscript.ts](https://github.com/Sv443/Userscript.ts) - for creating Userscripts in TypeScript with tons of modern utilities and comfort features.
- [Electron-Template](https://github.com/Sv443/Electron-Template) - TypeScript, Electron, Vite and ESLint template.
- [React-Three-Electron-Template](https://github.com/Sv443/React-Three-Electron-Template) - Template for a React, MUI, Three.js, Electron, TypeScript and Vite project.

My projects are free and open source so I rely on donations to keep my servers and domains running.
