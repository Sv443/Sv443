### Hi there, I'm Sv443
I am a 20 year old full stack developer from Germany.  
My interests are in open source software, server and web development and PC and server hardware and infrastructure.  
Most of my projects are made with or for Node.js, Linux, Arduino or C++.  
Although I love working in a familiar environment, I'm always open to try out new technologies and want to continue learning and improving my skills.  
  
### What I'm currently working on:
- [JokeAPI](https://github.com/Sv443/JokeAPI), as the name implies, is an API that serves jokes [(read more)](https://jokeapi.dev)
- [SvCoreLib](https://github.com/Sv443-Network/SvCoreLib), which is a Node.js package that is used in basically all of my JavaScript projects. It contains many miscellaneous features
- [BetterYTM](https://github.com/Sv443/BetterYTM), a userscript that improves the website YouTube Music with various features and UX improvements
<!-- - [Townly](https://github.com/Sv443/Townly) - I've challenged myself to create a city building game in the command line, with an accompanying game engine, [Teng.](https://github.com/Sv443/Teng)
-->
